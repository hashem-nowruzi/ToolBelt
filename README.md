# ToolBelt
It would be great if we had **all the useful tools** we need in **one place** and with **the smallest possible size**. 
ToolBelt does exactly the same thing, but with a few key advantages:

* All data is stored on the client side.
* It can work without a server.
* It can be personalized. This means that the user can create a collection of his own tools.
