# How to Add a New Tool
1. Copy this code and paste it in the tools section and put the name of your tool instead of `[Your Tool Name]`:  
    ```html
    <div class="tool">
        <a href="./tools/[Your Tool Name].html">
            <img src="./svg/[Your Tool Name].svg" alt="[Your Tool Name]" width="100px" height="100px">
            <span>[Your Tool Name]</span>
        </a>
    </div>
    ```
   
2. Create a html file in the `tools` folder with the name of your tool.
3. Add a tool icon with the same tool name in the `svg` folder.  
   (Note: This file must have the svg extension.)
